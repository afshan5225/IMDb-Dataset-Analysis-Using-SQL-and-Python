# IMDb Dataset Analysis Using SQL and Python

This repository contains a project that demonstrates how to perform data exploration, cleaning, and analysis on an IMDb movie dataset using SQL queries executed in Python. The project utilizes SQLite for database management and pandas for data manipulation. 

### Key Features:
- **Data Exploration**: Fetching and exploring movie and director data from the SQLite database.
- **SQL Query Execution**: Using SQL queries to analyze various aspects of the dataset, including movie popularity, budget, revenue, and director performance.
- **Data Analysis**: In-depth analysis of budget, revenue, and voting patterns to uncover insights about top movies and directors.
- **Python Integration**: Leveraging Python's pandas library to work with SQL query results and create DataFrames for further analysis.

### Skills Demonstrated:
- SQL querying and filtering.
- Data manipulation with pandas.
- Database connection and management using SQLite.
- Python scripting for automated data analysis.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sqlite3`).
3. Run the notebook to explore and analyze the IMDb dataset.
